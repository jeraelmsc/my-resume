			<hr>
  			<p>I am currently an undergraduate student with interdisciplinary knowledge on the arts and culture. As I aspire to be an architect and curator, my research interests lean toward the symbiosis of art, architecture, and criticism in the Philippine contemporary setting. I am proficient in writing, research, and project management, skills that I continue to hone through volunteering and internship experiences.</p>
